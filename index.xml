This New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve you have so many new resolutions that you need to get them into one place, and make them public, so you can be as transparent as your nearest politician is.

From deepest lows, to highest highs! I have my disguise, so to not fall into wrong eyes and pop out of surprise. I have my tools, I make my life. My house is on the rock. Rock &amp;rsquo;n Roll. From trashbin, to your soulmate.
